# Machine Learning Waste Classification Model

## Data source:
The dataset has over 22,5000 images and is divided into train data (85 %) and test data (15 %).

**Note:** Within the index.py and main.py files, you may need to change some file paths to match your system path structure. Within the main.py file, change the paths for line 14 and 15. Within the index.py file, change the paths for lines 14 and 41. 

## Steps:
* Download all files.
* Change file paths if necessary.
* Train you model and save it as "final_model_weights.hdf5". Or use my saved model directly: [download here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14etoYYQeiAM37r1Yc-NxrnbPzXe88aG0/view?usp=sharing).
* Run the index.py file ==> python index.py
* Open brower at "localhost:5000".
* Select an image file using the "Choose File" button and then click on "Submit".
* This should return a classification and probability score.
* Enjoy!
