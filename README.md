# Machine Learning Waste Classification Model

**Note:** Within the index.py and main.py files, you may need to change some file paths to match your system path structure. Within the main.py file, change the paths for line 14 and 15. Within the index.py file, change the paths for lines 14 and 41. 

## Steps:
* Download all files, including the trained python model "".
* Change file paths per above instructions
* Run the index.py file ==> python index.py
* Open brower at "localhost:5000".
* Select an image file using the "Choose File" button and then click on "Submit".
